# Day 17: More Exceptions

Write a `Calculator` class with a single `int power(int, int)` method. The
`power` method takes two integers, `n` and `p`, as parameters and return the
integer result of `n^p`. If either `n` or `p` is negative, then the method must
throw an exception with the message `n and p should be non-negative`.
