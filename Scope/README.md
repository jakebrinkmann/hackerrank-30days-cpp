# Day 14: Scope

The `Difference` class is already started. It has a private integer array `elements` for storing `N` non-negative integers, and a public integer `maximumDifference` for storing the absolute difference.

Complete the `Difference` class with:
* A class constructor taking an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the `elements` variable
* A  `computeDifference` method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in `elements` and stores it in the  `maximumDifference` instance variable
