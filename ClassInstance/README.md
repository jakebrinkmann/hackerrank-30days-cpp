# Day 4: Class vs. Instance

Write a `Person` class with `yearPasses` and `amIOld` methods.

    yearPasses(): Increase age by 1
    amIOld(): Young, Teenager, or Old

The test program `main` will take `T`, the number of test runs. For each run,
the program will print `amIOld`, followed by 3 `yearPasses`, finished with
`amIOld`.
